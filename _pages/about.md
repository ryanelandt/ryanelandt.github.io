Hello! I'm a software engineer with a dynamics background who has a passion for solving complex problems. During my time as a PhD student at Cornell University, I honed my skills in creating mathematical models for dynamical systems, which I've put to use on a variety of exciting projects.

As a consultant for ULC Technologies, I developed mathematical models and control designs for a robot that wraps fiber optic cable around power lines. Later, as an engineer at Dextrous Robotics, I wrote task space control code for a robot that unloads semi-trucks. My PhD dissertation describes a contact model I invented, which you can try out in the Drake physics engine.

In my free time, I enjoy discovering new places and cuisines. I especially like hiking, camping, and generally spending time outside. Thank you for visiting my personal website. I look forward to connecting with you.
