The characteristics of a beach are shaped by interactions between ocean waves and the topography of the ocean floor. As waves approach the shore, the gradual reduction in water depth causes them to slow down, increase in height, and eventually crest over. At certain beaches, the placement of sandbars can create [rip currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current), making it challenging for swimmers to reach the shore at certain locations. Furthermore, the shape of the ocean floor affects wave height and can create spots with sizeable waves that are favored by surfers. Each beach has its own distinct features due to the natural variability of the ocean floor.

Ocean topography engineering has been explored as a means of concentrating wave energy in specific areas to increase the efficiency and commercial viability of wave energy extraction. During my undergraduate studies at [TAFLab](https://taflab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, I was tasked with experimentally demonstrating how engineered topographies can concentrate wave energy. To showcase this effect on a small scale, I led a team of approximately ten individuals, including graduate students and professors, in constructing a 2.4m x 2.4m topography. Additionally, I developed a way to measure the elevation of the two-dimensional water surface over time using laser-induced fluorescence. After a month of intense coding, I analyzed the results and found that they aligned with simulations. I published the results of this experiment in [Physical Review E](https://taflab.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2013-Gavity-wave-lensing-PRE-AlamElandtShakeri1.pdf).

<!-- I experimentally demonstrated the lensing of gravity waves. Gravity wave lensing in a phenomenon in which part of an incident wave spectrum gets reflected when it is sent over a certain topography due to the non-linear interaction between the surface gravity waves and the topography. This idea could be used to concentrate ocean wave energy into a small area where a single wave energy conversion device could be placed, potentially leading to commercially viable wave energy extraction by allowing higher energy outputs per device. To demonstrate this on a small scale, I was in charge of constructing the 2.4m square topography and making sure that the videos could be analyzed. I oversaw a group of about ten people who helped with the construction of the topography. The majority of them were UCB graduate students and professors. In addition to the topography, I devised a way to measure the elevation of this two-dimensional surface as a function of time. I did this using a technique called laser-induced fluorescence. I wrote software to analyze the videos and recreated the surface as a function of time. After an intensive month of coding, I viewed the results and found that they agreed with simulations. I published a paper in February in Physical Review E as first author.4 -->
